## General Information

---

A farly simple TypeScript project that is a phrases guessing game - aka Hangman. Styling is pretty basic, but I have plans to update and improve this. I wanted to try a bit of TypeScript in with a starter project to get my feet wet. Styling the Keyboard took some creativity and learning how to use the useCallback hook was an added bonus.

## Features

---

Start Page:

- Starts out with an empty gallows (again, I'm working on changing the visuals)

![start](ui/demo_pictures/Screenshot%202023-01-20%20at%203.00.18%20PM.png 'Game Start')

- You can use the keyboard or your mounse to select leters to try and guess the phrase.
- Letters are highlighted as you hover (blue) and when selected change in colour to indicate a correct letter (green) or incorrect (faded out) letter for the phrase.

Incorrect Letter Choice:

- When an incorrect letter is selected an item is added to the picture.

Game Lost:

- After 6 incorrect guesses the phrase is revealed with missing letters shown in red and a 'Try Again' banner is shown.

## Room for Improvement

Improvement Thoughts:

- I have added a hint button that will show a hint to the phrase when pushed, but currently it does not work.

![hint](./demo_pictures/Screenshot%202023-01-20%20at%203.18.46%20PM.png 'Hint')

- I would like to change the hangman image to a house suspended by balloon to remove a bit of the 'death' feel to the game. Something like this:

![house](./demo_pictures/Screenshot%202023-01-20%20at%203.05.37%20PM.png 'balloon house')

- Potential for backend addition to create user login to track wins vs losses.

To do:

- [ ] Give hint button functionality
- [ ] Update styling
- [ ] Update image
- [ ] Add winner slogan
